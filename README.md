# Snooopy-OpenGL

This project is a Python implementation of a 2D rendering program using OpenGL and GLFW. It reads vertex data from a file (`snoopy.txt`) and renders the shapes described by the vertices. The project demonstrates file handling, data parsing, and basic 2D graphics rendering.

## **Features**
- Reads vertex data from a text file (`snoopy.txt`).
- Renders shapes using OpenGL (line strips and polygons).
- Supports multiple shapes with different drawing modes.
- Uses GLFW for window management and OpenGL for rendering.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `glfw`, `PyOpenGL`, `numpy`

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install glfw PyOpenGL numpy
```
